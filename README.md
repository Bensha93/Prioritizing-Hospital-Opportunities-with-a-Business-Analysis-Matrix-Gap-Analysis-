# Prioritizing Hospital Opportunities with a Business Analysis Matrix

As the in-house Business Analyst at our hospital, I leveraged gap analysis to identify key operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement in patient care. To address these challenges, I developed a Business Analysis Matrix using Microsoft Excel that evaluates and prioritizes strategic opportunities based on their impact and feasibility.

## Overview

This project is a critical initiative aimed at enhancing our hospital's operational efficiency and patient satisfaction while driving long-term growth. By categorizing opportunities into four quadrants—High Impact/High Feasibility, High Impact/Low Feasibility, Low Impact/High Feasibility, and Low Impact/Low Feasibility—the matrix provides a clear, data-driven framework for strategic decision-making.
